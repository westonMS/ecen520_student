# SystemVerilog Overview

In this lecture we will review the key syntax and semantics of SystemVerilog that you learned in ECEN 220/ECEN 323 (we will not cover any new material that you have not had in a previous class).
We will focus primarily on syntax for structural design in SystemVerilog and combinational logic design using dataflow statements.

<!-- Get them started on basic RTL SV design to complete first two labs -->
