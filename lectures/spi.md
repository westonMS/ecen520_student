# SPI Protocol

For one of your assignments you will be implementing an SPI controller to communicate with a SPI device.
In this lecture we will review the SPI protocol and discuss how you can implement this protocol in RTL.

**Reading**

* [Analog Devices SPI Protocol Overview](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/introduction-to-spi-interface.html)
  * Understand what each of the signals do
  * Understand the timing of SPI Mode 0 in detail
  * Understand multi-subnode configuration in Figure 6
* [Accelerometer Data Sheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ADXL362.pdf) pages 21-37
  * Understand how register reads and writes are performed using SPI on this device (page 21-22)
  * Briefly scan through the pages of device registers (no need to read them in detail - just become familiar with what registers are availablex``)

**Reference**


**Key Concepts**

  * Basic SPI protocol operation
  * How multiple devices can operate on the same SPI bus
  * How to read and write registers on the ADXL362 accelerometer using SPI
