# SystemVerilog Testbenches

Testbenches are an essential part of validating digital design systems.
In this lecture we will discuss the purpose of testbenches and the general structure of a simple testbench.

**Reading**
  * Chapter 1 of [System Verilog for Verification](https://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/record/cram.101.978-0-387-76530-3.1?holding=150kxz8ppcvbzc2x). Download this pdf from the library as we will use it later in the semester.
  * [Stephen Edwards Verilog Slides (48-56)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2005/languages-summer/verilog.pdf)

**Key Concepts**
  * Difference between tcl scripts and Verilog behavioral testbenches
  * Discrete time simulation model in Verilog (use of `#` operator)
  * Essential components of a testbench
  * initial block and how it differs from always block
  * How to use basic system functions: `$display`, `$time`, `$random`, `$timeformat`, etc.
  * How to create a basic testbench
