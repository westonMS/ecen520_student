# ECEN 520 Tools

These instructions describe how to access and run the tools we will be using for the class.

## Department Computers

These tools are installed in the digital lab (EB 423) and the embedded systems lab (EB 438).
You can access these computers in person or remotely with your CAEDM account.

### Digital Lab Computers

There are 61 computers in the digital lab (room EB 423).
These computers can be accessed as `digital-XX.et.byu.edu` where `XX` is the number of the computer
(Note that the number is two digits, so computer 1 is `digital-01.et.byu.edu`).
Computers 1-60 are student stations and computer 61 is the TA station in the back.

### Embedded Lab Computers

There are 24 computers in the embedded lab (room EB 438).
These computers can be accessed as `embed-XX.ee.byu.edu` where `XX` is the number of the computer (note that the number is two digits, so computer 1 is `embed-01.ee.byu.edu`).
